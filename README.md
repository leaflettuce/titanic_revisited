# Titanic Survival Predictions with XG Boosted Tree

## Goals


#### Give the titanic dataset another go 
```
I want to give the titanic classificaiton problem another go now that I'm a little more experienced. 
My first attempt at this was in my Udacity Nanodegree program when I had little idea how even decisions 
trees went about classification. I believe I had an accuracy of around 76% back then?

```

#### Experiment with XGBoost
```
I've heard a lot about XG lately and want to see how it works. I've had a lot of 
luck in the past with Adaboost and I'd like to see the similarities and
differences between the two.
