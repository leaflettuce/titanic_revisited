# Titanic Survival Predictions with XG Boosted Tree

## Goal


###Give the titanic dataset another go 
```
Now that I'm a little more experienced. My first attempt at this was in my 
Udacity Nanodegree program when I had little idea how even decisions trees 
went about classification.

```
###Experiment with XGBoost
```
I've heard a lot about XG lately and want to see how it works. I've had a lot of 
luck in the past with Adaboost and I'd like to see the similarities and
differences between the two.
